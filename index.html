              Hello! My name is Ayushman, and I am currently pursuing my
              <div class="aboutmetextblue">Engineering Bachelor</div>
              degree from Thapar University. I made my first UI design in 2020
              and it has been an exiciting journey since then. I have 3 years of
              experience in
              <div class="aboutmetextblue">UI/UX Design</div>
              and 2 years of experience in

            <div class="aboutmetexttext">
              I would describe myself as a curious person looking to learn new
              things everyday. One lesson that I have gathered in my life till
              is that one should experience what they have learned. No work is
              out of your bounds if you have the right preparation. I strive for
              challenges and like to learn new skills. I love designing and
              slowly but surely I am taking the steps forward. I have honed my
              expertise in various technologies such as
              <div class="aboutmetextblue">C, C++, Python,</div>
              as well as front-end development using
              <div class="aboutmetextblue">HTML5, CSS3, JS, TS</div>
              and
              <div class="aboutmetextblue">Angular</div>
              With a keen interest in exploring new frontend & backend
              technologies, I have recently started learning
              <div class="aboutmetextblue">
                React.js, Node.js and Express.js
              </div>
              , further expanding my skill set. My portfolio features a
              collection of my projects that highlight my technical proficiency
              and creativity. Let's take a <a>tour</a> together!
